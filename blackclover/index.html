   <p>Black Clover is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yūki Tabata. The story centers around Asta, a young boy born without any magic power. This is unknown to the world he lives in because seemingly everyone has some sort of magic power.</p>

<h3>This anime was released in <span>October 3rd 2017</span></h3>

<blockquote>The series focuses on Asta, a young orphan who left to be raised in an orphanage alongside his fellow orphan, Yuno. While everyone is born with the ability to utilize Mana in the form of Magical Power (魔力, Maryoku), Asta with no magic, however, instead focuses on physical strength. Conversely, Yuno was born as a prodigy with immense magical power and the talent to control wind magic. Motivated by a desire to become the next Wizard King, an authority figure second to the king of Clover Kingdom, the two youths developed a friendly rivalry.</blockquote>
